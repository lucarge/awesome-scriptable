# Awesome Scriptable

### Collection of script to make your iPhone more powerful

The scripts inside the `src/` directory are meant to be used with [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app).

Simply download the ones you want to use and put them in the iCloud Drive directory of Scriptable.

Finally, from your iPhone, assign a voice shortcut to the script from within the Scriptable app and you're done!
